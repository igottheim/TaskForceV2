Welcome to the Flatiron Discord! The goal of this app is to create a community help desk to answer questions specifically for each of the 4 Flatiron Phases. Do you have questions about JavaScript, React, Ruby, or Rails? Signup or Login to chat with live users to answer the questions you are stuck on.
